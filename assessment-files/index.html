        <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
       
        <!-- Introduction paragraphs -->
        <p>
          Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, 
          independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing 
          like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, 
          <em>The Jungle Book</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? 
          In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>

        <!-- Subsection: Types of bear -->
        <h3>Types of bear</h3>
        <p>
          Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you 
          have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
        </p>

        <!-- Subsection: Habitats and Eating habits -->
        <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
        <p>
          Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. 
          In general they will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will 
          track down their sustenance from farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative 
          isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt 
          other urban creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer 
          to scavenge from readily available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. 
          When food has proven scarce, urban bears have even been known to break into people's kitchens and 
          steal essentials like baked beans, ready meals, and microwave ovens.
        </p>

           <figcaption>Urban bears often scavenge food from dumpsters in city environments.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to the toilets in McDonalds, 
          to their own apartment.
        </p>

        <!-- Subsection: Mating rituals -->
        <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
        <p>
          Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest 
          of their lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for example 
          with cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD in 
          the case of an urban bear.
        </p>

                <p>Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. 
                   With their sniffing little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — 
                   I was thinking of putting them all in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.
